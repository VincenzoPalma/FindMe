# FindMe
FindMe is a tool for game engines that enables the use of CTL model checking to develop advanced AI behavior for NPCs.
Developed in Unreal Engine 5, with the core system implemented in C++ and its functionality integrated through Blueprints for ease of use.

The system has been utilized to model the behavior of NPCs in a simple chase game set within a labyrinthine map.
